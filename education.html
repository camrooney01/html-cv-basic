      <h2>North Lanarkshire College</h2>
      <p>I have completed, and half completed, some college courses since I left Secondary School also.</p>
      <p>One of the courses I completed was a NQ Law & Criminology Course, where I passed multiple outcomes, such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Family Law</li>
        <li>Property Law</li>
        <li>Criminal Law</li>
        <li>Contract Law</li>
        <li>Administrative Law</li>
        <li>Communication Units</li>
        <li>Criminology</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I also got halfway through a HNC Computer Science course, before realising that the traditional approach to learning this matter didn't suit me.</p>
      <p>However, I learned a large part of Java and Python in this course, which I believe benefited me as I transitioned into the self-learning aspect.</p>
