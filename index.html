    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring full stack developer, currently learning HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, Python, React and Node.JS. I began self-learning in April 2023
      and would love to work my way into the professional world of Web
      Development, by early 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a hardworking person, with experience in administration and working
      in public sectors. I take pride in being able to adapt to different
      environments and being able to think on my feet when it comes to solving
      problems.
